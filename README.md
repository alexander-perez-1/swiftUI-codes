Codes for the different programs we had to do for the Programming Multimedia Apps class..
Do not use these since they are probably inefficient and not with the best practices. I am still just a beginner with SwiftUI.
Also, I did not do a good job at tidying up the files and keeping track of which ones work. There are probably some broken programs in there. 
You have been warned. If you want, use it as a guide, but don't copy.
